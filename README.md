For this task, I worked on an Online Examination System project, implementing features like:
✅ Secure Login and Profile Management
✅ Real-time Timer with Auto-Submission
✅ MCQ Selection 
✅ Session Logout for user security
This project challenged me to apply my skills in Java, database connectivity, and problem-solving, and I’m thrilled with the results!
